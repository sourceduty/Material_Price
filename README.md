Rebar Price in Canada for 2024

![Raw Rebar](https://github.com/sourceduty/Material_Price/assets/123030236/c1bfa61a-f08a-43f8-a0b7-24970aec96f2)

As of June 2024, the price of rebar in Canada exhibits significant variability depending on the region and specific market conditions. The average price for rebar stands at approximately USD 96.22 per net ton (NT). This average, however, masks a broader range where prices can be as low as USD 25 per NT and can reach as high as USD 272 per NT. These figures indicate that the rebar market is influenced by localized factors and possibly by fluctuating demand and supply dynamics across different Canadian regions​.

Market trends for rebar in North America, including Canada, have shown some stability with minor fluctuations over recent months. For example, the North American Rebar Index, which includes data from Canada, recorded a value of 271.8 points in April 2024. This suggests a relatively stable market with slight variations that reflect the normal ebb and flow of construction activities and other economic factors influencing steel demand​​.

The pricing of rebar is heavily influenced by several factors. Regional demand, particularly in construction-heavy areas, plays a crucial role. Supply dynamics, including the availability of raw materials and production capacity, also impact prices. Furthermore, global steel market trends and local economic conditions, such as infrastructure projects and seasonal construction activities, contribute to the variability in rebar prices across Canada​​.

For more detailed and specific information about rebar pricing in particular regions or other related inquiries, further localized research or contacting local suppliers might be necessary.
